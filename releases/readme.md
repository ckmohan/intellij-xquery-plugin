This directory will contain pre-built jar files which implement the
XQuery plugin.  The jar will need to be placed into the appropriate
plugin directory where IntelliJ can find it on your OS.  On the Mac,
this is #HOME/Library/APplication Support/IntelliJIdea11.

This is temporary.  Once the code is ready for public consumption,
the compiled plugin will be pushed to the IntelliJ community site
so that it can be downloaded directly from within IntelliJ.

NOTE: If you have an XQuery.xml in the filetypes directory of
your IntelliJ preferences, you will need to move it out of the
way, because it will interfere with the plugin code.
